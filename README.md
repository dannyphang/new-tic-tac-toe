<h1>Welcome to new Tic Tac Toe game!</h1>
  <br />

  <p class="font-mono">
    This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game. You can <b>ONLY</b> play with your friend
    with current version.
  </p>
  <p class="font-mono">
    This Tic Tac Toe is same as the classic Tic Tac Toe. The winning condition
    is to get 3 same shapes in a row, column or diagonal.
  </p>
  <p class="font-mono">
    But the interesting part is each player can only place up to 3 shapes in the
    game board. After you placed the <u><b>THIRD</b></u
    >, the <u><b>FIRST</b></u> shape will be faded to indicate that the shape
    will be <u><b>DISAPPEAR</b></u> from the board at the next turn. So, the
    board will always have 3 shapes from each player.
  </p>

  <p class="font-mono">Enjoy!</p>
